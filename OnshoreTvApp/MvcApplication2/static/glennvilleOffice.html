    The main building of the GDC was built in 1915 when the wooden schoolhouse burned down. 
    This building was the Glennville Primary school for many years and was the Glennville Middle School until 1993 when the school 
    was relocated to the former Glennville High School building two blocks East.

    Between 2000-2002 it was retrofitted by Southeastern Technical College and operated the Glennville Campus for the next twelve years.

    Onshore began operations on July 15 in temporary space next door and moved into the main building on September 17th.
     At that time there were 11 associates and the 2nd bootcamp class of 10.
