   Glennville is located in Tattnall County, Georgia and has a population of 3,600 and is located about an hour and fifteen minutes West-South-West of Savannah. The main building was built in 1915 when the wooden schoolhouse burned down,
   It remained the Glennville Primary school for many years and was the Glennville Middle School until 1993 when the school was relocated to the former Glennville High School building two blocks East. (2013 was the 20th anniversary of the Tattnall County High School). Between 2000-2002 it was retrofitted by Southeastern Technical College.
   STC operated the Glennville Campus for the next twelve years. Onshore started operations in temporary quarters next door July 15 when Dan Nixon and Jessie Taffer relocated from Macon, MO. Delivery Center Operations moved into the main building on September 17th once the final agreements were reached with the State of GA and Tattnall County Representatives. At that time there were 11 associates and the 2nd bootcamp class of 10.
